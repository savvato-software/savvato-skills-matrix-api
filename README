A ready-to-go, basic implementation of a Spring Boot server with REST endpoints for creating a user, and logging in with JWT Authorization. Your user can have a ROLE. This is generally a good start for any application which is going to have a frontend where users need to login and access their own stuff, not other people's stuff.
